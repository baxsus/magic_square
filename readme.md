## Magic Squares (C++ College Assignment)

###### Background:
A *magic square of order n* is an *n* x *n* square array containing the integers 1, 2, 3, ..., *n*^2 
arranged so that the sum of each row, each column and each diagonal are all the same. 

###### **Objective:**  
In this project, you will use problems related to magic squares to gain familiarity with the 
manipulation of two-dimensional arrays. The first problem will be that of testing a magic square,
and the second will involve generating a magic square.

What's needed in the project:
1. Two-Dimensional Array Printer (outputs 2d array to console)
2. A Magic-Square-Checker Function (checks if the 2d array is a magic square)
3. A Magic Square Constructor (generates an **odd** magic square of order *n*)
